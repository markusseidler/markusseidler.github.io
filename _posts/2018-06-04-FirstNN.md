## My first Neural Network

This is a huge and intimidating topic. It sounds complicated, mysterious,
and impossible to master if you do not have a PhD in Maths, Computer Science,
and Artifical Intelligence. But... it is incredibly exciting. I believe,
as long as you are excited about something you can master it. At the end,
90% of the problems in the world, need just one basic ingredient.
Common sense.

Thinking about Neural Network is for me pure excitement and the more I
explore it, the more I see the power of it. Imagine, how our world will
look like once machines can see, move, and think as individual units and
as part of our society. I am fully certain that this will come and exploring
Neural Networks with today's data availability and computer processing power
is a first step on a journey towards this future.

As the famous Chinese philosopher and founder of the Taoism Lao Zi (老子) said:

###"千里之行始于足下"

("A Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step")
