### What is the sine function?

Sine is one the major functions in trigonometry. The sine function of a right triangle
is the ratio of the angle-opposite side compared to the hypotenuse. Sine can also 
be often found in nature and two of the most common observations are that sound 
and light waves are following sine patterns.

For me, it describes the perfectness and harmony of a circle.
