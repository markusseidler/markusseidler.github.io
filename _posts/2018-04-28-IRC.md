# Why I am doing this?

Mainly, just for fun. I want to train a machine learning algorithm that
recognizes single fruits in a picture. I like fruits and sometimes I
encounter exotic fruits in Singapore and I have no glue what they are.
Would it not be great to have a machine learning algorithm telling you
which fruit you see?

# How am I doing this?

Good question. First, I will conduct some exploratory data analysis to
visualize an image array. I am planning to convert colored RGB images to
grey-scale for easier processing and will flatten it to a 1d array.
After that, I am thinking of using Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest,
and Support Vector Machine algorithms. On purpose, I will not use any
neural network in this case such as Convoluational Neural Network and
TensorFlow. I want to see how far I can go with using standard classifiers.

# Should we start?

Python code block:


```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function (x, y):
    z = np.sum(x,y)
    return z
```
