## Why I am doing this?


Mainly, just for fun. I want to train a machine learning algorithm that
recognizes single fruits in a picture. I like fruits and sometimes I
encounter exotic fruits in Singapore and I have no glue what they are.
Would it not be great to have a machine learning algorithm telling you
which fruit you see?


## How am I doing this?


Good question. First, I will conduct some exploratory data analysis to
visualize an image array. I am planning to convert colored RGB images to
gray-scale for easier processing and will flatten it to a 1D array.
After that, I am thinking of using Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest,
and Support Vector Machine algorithms. On purpose, I will not use any
neural network in this case such as Convoluational Neural Network and
TensorFlow. I want to see how far I can go by using standard classifiers.


## Should we start?


First, let's look at the underlying dataset. I use the Fruits 360 dataset
found on Kaggle.com. The dataset consists of 38,409 images of 60 fruits
from different angles. Image size is 100x100 pixels and the dataset is
divided in 28,736 images for training purpose and 9,673 images for validation.

Dataset was provided by Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition
from images using deep learning, Technical Report, Babes-Bolyai University.
Thank you!

For example,

Bananas...

You don't know meh? Salak or Snake Fruit. 蛇皮果. Try it!


## Image Arrays


Every image is a three dimensional array. While the first two dimensions
identify the location of the pixel, the third dimension indicates the
color with a value beteen 0 and 255 for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).

The intesity of each of these three color channels can be displayed by
splitting it in three images. Each of them displays only one color channel,
Red, Green, or Blue.

This is the shape of an image with a banana. The Example array displays
the pixels in the row 50, 51, and 52 and in the column 50, 51, and 52.
Each of the pixels consist of three color channels.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/example_array.PNG"
alt="Example Array">

I use object-orienated programming and create a class called "ImageArray".
Within this class I write a method that takes out one of the three color
channels and puts it in to a new image.


```python

import numpy as np
import cv2

class ImageArray:
    def __init__(self, image):
        self.image = image
        self.array = np.array(self.image, dtype=np.uint8)
        self.blue, self.green, self.red = cv2.split(self.image)

    def split_color(self):

        zeros = np.zeros ([100,100],dtype=np.uint8)
        red_pic = cv2.merge([zeros, zeros, self.red])
        green_pic = cv2.merge([zeros, self.green, zeros])
        blue_pic = cv2.merge([self.blue, zeros, zeros])
        horizontal_stack = np.hstack((self.image, red_pic,
        green_pic, blue_pic))

```


Then I initiate a class with one particular image. For instance, a picture of
an apple.


```python
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/
Apple Red 2/118_100.jpg")

apple = ImageArray(img)
```


The first image shows the original picture, the others show the same picture
by displaying only one color channel. If the color is dark, then the relevant
color channel value is closer to 0.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/color_channels_apple.jpg"
alt="Apple Color Split">


Here is a Strawberry.


```python
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/
Strawberry/r_252_100.jpg")

strawberry = ImageArray(img)
strawberry.split_color()
```


The strawberry is the brightest in the red channel but looks dark in
green and blue.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/color_channels_berry.jpg"
alt="Strawberry Color Split">


For easier processing, I decided not to work with colors but to change
the images to gray scale. I add another method to my class ImageArray.


```python
    def gray(self):
        self.image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(self.image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        return self.image_gray
```


Let's use an example of a Mandarine.


```python
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Mandarine/r_135_100.jpg")

mandarine = ImageArray(img)
mandarine.gray()
```


The class method displays the image in gray-scale.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/gray_scale.jpg"
alt="Mandarine Gray">


I want to visualize the color distribution and choose to flatten this two
dimensional array consisting of x, y values for each pixel into a one
dimensional array. I want to see a single vector with a series of gray
color values. I write a new method to my class ImageArray.


```python
    def gray_flat(self):
        self.image_gray_flat = self.gray().flatten()

mandarine.gray_flat()
print ("\n\tOriginal shape of the image:\n\t", mandarine.image.shape)
print ("\n\tShape of the image after converting it to gray-scale:\n\t",
mandarine.image_gray.shape)
print ("\n\tShape of the image after flattening:\n\t", mandarine.image_gray_flat.shape)
```


We transformed the original 3D array to 2D and finally to 1D array with
10,000 color inputs in gray.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/flat.png"
alt="Flattening">


Now we can display the color distribution in a KDE plot to show the
bivariate density. I also create a countplot to visualize the peaks of
the underlying color value. I use the Seaborn libary in addition to
matplotlib for a better visualization.

Just a small detail, traditionally, opencv converts images to Blue,
Green, Red arrays. In order to display them correctly in matplotlib, I
need to convert them into the standard color format Red, Green, Blue.


```python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#creating class instances for each image
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Mandarine/r_135_100.jpg")
mandarine = ImageArray(img)
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Strawberry/r_252_100.jpg")
strawberry = ImageArray(img)
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Apple Red 2/118_100.jpg")
apple = ImageArray(img)
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Banana/104_100.jpg")
banana = ImageArray(img)
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Mango/253_100.jpg")
mango = ImageArray(img)
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Avocado/r_19_100.jpg")
avocado = ImageArray(img)

#storing class names in list for reiteration
fruits = [mandarine, strawberry, apple, banana, mango, avocado]

#designing basic framework of chart plot
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(fruits),ncols=3, figsize = (15,12))

#reiterating through each image
for i, fruit in zip(range(len(fruits)), fruits):
    x = fruit.gray_flat()

    #if right, show image, if middle, show kdeplot, if left, show countplot
    for j in range(3):
        if j == 0:
            axes[i][j].imshow(cv2.cvtColor(fruit.array, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
        if j == 1:
            sns.kdeplot(np.arange(len(x)),x, cmap="magma_r", shade=True, ax=axes[i][j])
            axes[i][j].set_ylim([0, 255])
        if j == 2:
            axes[i][j].tick_params(axis="x", which="both", bottom=False, top=False,
                                   labelbottom=False)
            axes[i][j].set_ylim([0, 200])
            sns.countplot(x, ax=axes[i][j])

#labelling plots and axes
axes[0][0].set_title("Original fruit image")
axes[len(fruits)-1][0].set_xlabel("Pixel")
axes[0][1].set_title("KDE plot of 1d gray-scale array")
axes[len(fruits)-1][1].set_xlabel("Pixel flattened")
axes[0][2].set_title("Countplot of gray-color intensity")
axes[len(fruits)-1][2].set_xlabel("\nGray-color intensity 0/black (left) to 255/white (right)")

#save file as jpg image
fig.savefig("Image EDA.jpg")
```


I continue to use object-orientated programming and make use of the
class I created earlier called ImageArray. I then iterate through a
pre-defined list of fruits, and plot them one by one. The charts in
the middle show the KDE plot. The plot on the right axis counts the
color values.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/Image EDA.jpg"
alt="Image EDA">


The KDE plot is summary of a scatter plot and they all show fields of
intense color on the top left and top right side. Those fields are the
white backgrounds of the image. It can be also seen in the countplot.
The bin on the very right side shows the count of color 255. In other
words, how often does the color white appear in the image. In all case,
it is a peak from the rest of the color values. The strong distinction
between the background and the object, makes it easier for machine learning
algorithms to focus on the fruit object.


## First we prepare the data set


Each fruit image is in a folder that is named after the fruit. In order to
train a model, we need to prepare the dataset in a array with features
called X and into a matrix with labels called y. We convert every image to
a 1d array and store it image by image, row by row in X. X will be a 2d
array where each row is a flattened image in gray-scale. y will have all
the names of those images, the label of each of these rows. However, I
will use numbers instead of names for each fruit. Technically, y will contai
a list of numbers. I will store in another dictionary all the meanings of
these numbers. The dictionary "name_dictionary" will translate each number
to a fruit name.

The standard libary for machine learning is scikit-learn. I choose
RandomForest as first classifier as it is a strong algorithm.


```python
import os
import glob
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import pandas as pd
from timeit import default_timer as timer
```

OS and glob helps me to extract the folderlist with the fruit images.
I also like to measure how long it takes to run calculations. Therefore,
I work with timeit. If you wonder how come that the calculations are soooo
fast or soooo slow, just to let you know, I will use my standard CPU for it.
Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.8 GHz.


```python

start = timer()

#creating empty lists and dictionary
X_fruit_arrays = []
y_fruit_ID = []

name_dictionary = {}

count = 0

#reiterating through each file and each folder in the training set
for path in glob.glob("../DataSet/fruits-360/training/*"):
    path_split = path.split("/") [-1]
    name_dictionary[count] = path_split.split("\\")[-1]
    for pic in glob.glob (os.path.join(path,"*.jpg")):
        image = cv2.imread(pic,0)
        X_fruit_arrays.append(image)
        y_fruit_ID.append(count)

    count += 1

#setting type as numpy array and flatten the X array with list comprehension
X_fruit_arrays = np.array(X_fruit_arrays)
y_fruit_ID = np.array((y_fruit_ID))
X_fruit_arrays = [i.flatten() for i in X_fruit_arrays]

#Creating a pandas dataframe
fruits_training = pd.DataFrame()
fruits_training["y_ID"] = y_fruit_ID
fruits_training["X_flat_gray_array"] = X_fruit_arrays

#Let's show some info. And how long did the job take?
print ("\n\tAmount of row/images:\n\t")
print (fruits_training.info())
print ("\n\tLength of each image row:\n\t", len(X_fruit_arrays[0]))
end = timer()
duration = end - start
print ("\n\tDuration of processing in seconds: \n\t", round(duration,5))
```


The code looks through each image, loads the image as gray-scale, and
flattens the array to one single dimension. After that it saves the
image data in X and an ID number for each fruit in y. Finally, I put
everything together in a nice pandas dataframe. A huge table with 2 columns,
28,736 rows and each of the rows has a length of 10,000 numbers. A table
with 287 million numbers. How long did it take? 7.5 seconds. Not bad.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/dataframe_info.PNG"
alt="DataFrame Info">


How does a row of this dataframe look like? Let's have a look and extract
row 2000 and save it to an .html file.


```python
example = pd.DataFrame(fruits_training.iloc[2000])
example.to_html("example.html")
```


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/example.PNG"
alt="Example cell">


Each row has 10,000 numbers of gray-scale color intensity. 10,000 numbers
because we flattened 100x100 pixel images. Each row has also a number which
stands for the name of the fruit. This row, row 2000, is an image of the
fruit with the number 4. How do we know which fruit this is? For this,
we need to look into the "number_dictionary".


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/name_dictionary.PNG"
alt="Name Dict">


We see here a list of all 60 fruits. The number 4 stands for "Apple Granny Smith".


## Let's machine learn


Now it's time to start working with machine learning algorithms. It's to
train a classifier and test its results. It's time for the fun...

First, I prepare the data set for validation. Then I train the Random
Forest Classifier with the test data I prepared in the previous section.
After that I test the Classifier with the validaton data set and display
the accuracy ratio.


```python
count2 = 0
name_dictionary_test = {}
X_fruit_arrays_test = []
y_fruit_ID_test = []

for path in glob.glob("../DataSet/fruits-360/validation/*"):
    path_split = path.split("/") [-1]
    name_dictionary_test[count2] = path_split.split("\\")[-1]
    for pic in glob.glob (os.path.join(path,"*.jpg")):
        image = cv2.imread(pic,0)
        X_fruit_arrays_test.append(image)
        y_fruit_ID_test.append(count2)

    count2 += 1

#setting type as numpy array and flatten the X array with list comprehension
X_fruit_arrays_test = np.array(X_fruit_arrays_test)
y_fruit_ID_test = np.array(y_fruit_ID_test)
X_fruit_arrays_test = [i.flatten() for i in X_fruit_arrays_test]

#Creating a pandas dataframe
fruits_test = pd.DataFrame()
fruits_test["y_ID_test"] = y_fruit_ID_test
fruits_test["X_flat_gray_array_test"] = X_fruit_arrays_test

#Train the RandomForestClassifier based on the training data set
forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=5)
forest = forest.fit(X_fruit_arrays, y_fruit_ID)

#Test the RandomForestClassifier with the validation data set and print accuracy
test_predictions = forest.predict(X_fruit_arrays_test)
precision = accuracy_score(y_fruit_ID_test,test_predictions)*100
print ("\n\tRandom Forest Classifier with 5 trees.\n\t")
print ("\n\tAccuracy of guessing the right fruit on validation dataset in %:\n\t", round(precision,5))

end = timer()
duration = end - start
print ("\n\tDuration of processing in seconds: \n\t",
round(duration,5))
```


We validate the trained machine learning algorithm on 9,673 images of the
60 different fruits. A random forest is an estimator that fits a number of
decision trees on randomly selected sub-samples. The sub-samples are drawn
with replacement. In this case, I start with a number of ten trees
(n_estimators = 5).


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/rfc5.PNG"
alt="rfc5">


The machine learning algorithm was classified correctly 78.7% of the 9,673
images of the validation set. Well, it is not perfect but a good starting
point.


##Can we improve it?


Let's see if we can improve the accuracy by tweaking the algorithm. Let's
increase the number of trees, let's change the number of estimators. I
create a for-loop that trains the algorithm with 5 to 100 trees.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

estimator_range = range(5,105,5)
accuracy = []
duration = []

for estimator in estimator_range:
    start2 = timer()
    forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=estimator)
    forest = forest.fit(X_fruit_arrays, y_fruit_ID)
    test_predictions = forest.predict(X_fruit_arrays_test)
    precision = round(accuracy_score(y_fruit_ID_test,test_predictions)*100,5)
    accuracy.append(precision)
    end2 = timer()
    dur = round(end2-start2,5)
    duration.append (dur)

acc_df = pd.DataFrame()
acc_df ["Estimators"] = estimator_range
acc_df ["Accuracy"] = accuracy
acc_df ["Duration"] = duration

print (acc_df)

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

ax1.plot("Estimators", "Accuracy", data=acc_df, marker="o", markersize=6, markerfacecolor="blue",
         color="blue", linewidth=2)
ax1.set_xlabel ("Number of Trees")
ax1.set_ylabel ("Accuracy in %")

ax2 = ax1.twinx()

ax2.plot("Estimators", "Duration", data=acc_df, marker="o", markersize=6, markerfacecolor="red",
         color="red", linewidth=2)
ax2.set_ylabel ("Duration in seconds")

fig.legend(loc="upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(0.1,0.9))
fig.tight_layout()
fig.savefig("accuracy_and_duration.jpg")


end = timer()
duration = end - start
print ("\n\tDuration of processing in seconds: \n\t", round(duration,5))
```

These calculations are more process-intense and need around 25 minutes or
almost 1,500 seconds to complete. A linear increase in the number of trees
makes the calculations more complicated and more time-consuming.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/rfc5to100summary.PNG"
alt="rfc5to100 summary">


The accuracy ratio goes up by increasing the number of trees. At number of
100 trees, the accuracy is beyond 89%. However, achieving a higher accuracy
ratio has a trade-off. A linear increase in computational cost.


<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/accuracy_and_duration.PNG"
alt="Accuracy and duration">

The incremental gain of accuracy is diminishing and the marginal benefit of
increasing the number of trees beyond 40 is outpaced by a substantial
longer computation time. We achieve a local peak at a tree size of 55 and
I conclude that this machine learning algorithm can reasonably achieve
an accuracy ratio of 88%.
