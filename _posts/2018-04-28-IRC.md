## Why I am doing this?

Mainly, just for fun. I want to train a machine learning algorithm that
recognizes single fruits in a picture. I like fruits and sometimes I
encounter exotic fruits in Singapore and I have no glue what they are.
Would it not be great to have a machine learning algorithm telling you
which fruit you see?

## How am I doing this?

Good question. First, I will conduct some exploratory data analysis to
visualize an image array. I am planning to convert colored RGB images to
grey-scale for easier processing and will flatten it to a 1d array.
After that, I am thinking of using Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest,
and Support Vector Machine algorithms. On purpose, I will not use any
neural network in this case such as Convoluational Neural Network and
TensorFlow. I want to see how far I can go by using standard classifiers.

## Should we start?

First, let's look at the underlying dataset. I use the Fruits 360 dataset
found on Kaggle.com. The dataset consists of 38,409 images of 60 fruits
from different angles. Image size is 100x100 pixels and the dataset is
divided in 28,736 images for training purpose and 9,673 images for validation.

Dataset was provided by Horea Muresan, Mihai Oltean, Fruit recognition
from images using deep learning, Technical Report, Babes-Bolyai University.
Thank you!

For example,

Bananas...

That was is easy. But what is this?

You don't know meh? Salak or Snake Fruit. 蛇皮果. Try it!

## Image Arrays

Every image is a three dimensional array. While the first two dimensions
identify the location of the pixel, the third dimension indicates the
color with a value beteen 0 and 255 for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).

The intesity of each of these three color channels can be displayed by
splitting it in three images. Each of them displays only one color channel,
Red, Green, or Blue.

This is the shape of an image with a banana. The Example Array displays
the pixels in the row 50, 51, and 52 and in the column 50, 51, and 52.
Each of the pixels consist of three color channels.

I use object-orienated programming and created a class called "ImageArray".
Within this class I added a function that takes out one of the three color
channels and puts it in to a new image.

```Python

import numpy as np
import cv2

class ImageArray:
    def __init__(self, image):
        self.image = image
        self.array = np.array(self.image, dtype=np.uint8)
        self.blue, self.green, self.red = cv2.split(self.image)

    def split_color(self):

        zeros = np.zeros ([100,100],dtype=np.uint8)
        red_pic = cv2.merge([zeros, zeros, self.red])
        green_pic = cv2.merge([zeros, self.green, zeros])
        blue_pic = cv2.merge([self.blue, zeros, zeros])
        horizontal_stack = np.hstack((self.image, red_pic, green_pic, blue_pic))

```

Then I initiate a class with one particular image. For instance, a picture of
an apple.

```Python
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Apple Red 2/118_100.jpg")

apple = ImageArray(img)
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/color_channels_apple.PNG"
alt="Apple Color Split">

The first image shows the original picture, the others show the same picture
by displaying only one color channel. If the color is dark, then the relevant
color channel value is closer to 0.

Here is a Strawberry.

```Python
img = cv2.imread("../dataset/fruits-360/Training/Strawberry/r_252_100.jpg")

strawberry = ImageArray(img)
strawberry.split_color()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/IRC/color_channels_berry.PNG"
alt="Strawberry Color Split">
