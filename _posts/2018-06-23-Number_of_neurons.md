## Finding the optimal number of neurons?

While the weights are optimized by training the network, there are a few
hyperparameters which needs to be set at the beginning. Creating a neural network
is actually a problem of finding the right architecture.For example, what
is the optimal number of neurons?

In my previous post, I created an ANN with two hidden layers and each of the layers
had three neurons. Why three? Well, three is my lucky number. However, you could argue
that it may not be the lucky number of my neural network.

You could be very right with that. Therefore, it would be better, we reiterate
through a combination of network architectures with different amout of neurons
in hidden layer 2 and 3.
