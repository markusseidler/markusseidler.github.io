## How to improve my first ANN?

While the weights are optimized by training the network, there are a few
hyperparameters which needs to set at the beginning. Creating a neural network
is actually a problem of finding the right architecture.

What is the optimal number of neurons?

In my previous post, I created an ANN with two hidden layers and each of the layers
had three neurons. Why three? Well, three is my lucky number. However, it may
not be the lucky number of my neural network.

Therefore, I guess, it would be better, we reiterate through a combination of
network architectures with different amout of neurons in hidden layer 2 and 3.
