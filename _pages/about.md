I am just myself on this page. Curious and restless.

I love to explore the world by searching for problems. Being the outlier to see the unusual.

And understanding the main to bring unusual and usual together.

Manoeuvre between the forces.

纵横捭阖.

Long time ago, someone gave me the Chinese name... 捭阖.

Maybe for a reason...


## Study, study, study

In Chinese, there is a famous proverb 活到老，学到老. Freely translated it
means that you live long, you study long. Or in other words, one is never
too old to learn.

I thought it is a good idea to track the courses and classes I take on
my journey of Python and Machine Learning. Perhaps, it gives you some
hints for your own journey.
